Eat don't Shit! is a multiplayer game about eating out with family but having to 
take a shit. As people usually don't feel comfortable doing this elsewhere than
home, you need to try to avoid filling up the poop-meter by reaching the food 
that increases it. You are forced to grab something to eat as it is impolite to
neglect the hard work others have put into this.

It's a 4 player game where 2 players use 1 controller.

How to play the game:

- Connect two controllers
- Each player uses one stick to control their hand
- Press the corresponding trigger button to grab the food
- Avoid food that will make you poop quicker
- You lose the game if you need to poop

# Game Jam 2019

The theme of this game jam was: **What home means to you?**

*Eat don't Shit! is a multiplayer game about eating out with family but having to take a shit. As people usually don't feel comfortable doing this elsewhere than home, you need to try to avoid filling up the poop-meter by reaching the food that increases it. You are forced to grab something to eat as it is impolite to neglect the hard work others have put into this.*
